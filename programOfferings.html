          <h3>OUTCOMES-BASED EDUCATION (OBE)</h3>
          <p>
            The T.I.P. Implementation of outcomes-based education was driven by
            the following external entities: 1) Regulatory bodies such as the
            Commission on Higher Education (CHED), the Professional Regulation
            Commission (PRC), International Maritime Organization (IMO), among
            others, 2) Local and international accrediting bodies, specifically,
            the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission
            on Accreditation (PACUCOA), the Philippine Technological
            Council-Accreditation and Certification Board for Engineering and
            Technology - Engineering Accreditation Commission (PTC - ACBET -
            EAC), and ABET, Inc., 3) International certifying bodies, and 4)
            Feedback from other external constituents. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The institutional outcome statement was formulated based on the
            T.I.P. graduates attributes. Outcomes at the program level and
            course level were also formulated aligned with institutional
            outcomes.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The framework which T.I.P. adopted in its OBTL implementation
            revolves around three important elements: 1) Intended Learning
            Outcomes (ILOs), 2) Teaching and Learning Activities (TLAs) and 3)
            Assessment Tasks (ATs).<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            In support of T.I.P.’s outcomes-based education and as a strategy to
            promote academic excellence, T.I.P. has also embarked on a proactive
            plan to implement outcomes-based teaching and learning or OBTL in
            all its academic programs using the City University of Hong Kong
            OBTL model.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The OBE process is also supported by facilities, management
            processes and procedures resources and support structures
            sub-systems.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The results of the assessment and evaluation are used as inputs in
            the continual improvement of the instructional process specifically
            on the constructive alignment of ILOs, TLAs, and ATs.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            It is expected that the implementation of OBTL as part of T.I.P.’s
            OBE would hasten the realization of T.I.P.’s mission "to transform
            students into graduates with full competence in their fields of
            study and who also possess Filipino values, industry-desired values,
            and global citizen values”.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also guided by existing T.I.P. internal policies and
            initiatives: 1) The T.I.P. Vision, Mission, Core Values, and Core
            Competencies, 2) T.I.P. Quality Policy, and 3) Other T.I.P.
            initiatives that supported the OBE implementation such as a) the
            T.I.P. Faculty and Staff Development Program, and b) The T.I.P.
            Student Development Program.<br />
