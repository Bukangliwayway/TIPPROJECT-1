                        Engineering Senior Builds 4-In-1 Rechargeable Emergency Kit From Recycled Materials </h2>

                            Modern problems require simple solutions. <br><br>

                            This is what Paul Bryan Mancenido, an electrical engineering senior from the Technological
                            Institute of the Philippines (T.I.P.), proved with his 4-in-1 rechargeable emergency kit
                            built from scraps. <br><br>

                            The device – which won him the grand prize in T.I.P.'s Environmental Fair, and which
                            recently caught the attention of media giant GMA 7 – features a handy flashlight, lamp,
                            electric fan, and USB charging port all rolled into one. <br><br>

                            "My mantra has always been not to let go of scrap materials just yet. They can still be
                            reused and recycled, especially now when we can't easily go out due to the pandemic,"
                            Mancenido said, recalling that rainy day he thought of making his novel invention. <br><br>

                            As an only child, Mancenido grew up playing and experimenting with broken motor parts. His
                            father is an air-conditioning mechanic, while his mother is a housewife. When he was
                            younger, he would often repair devices for free. This hobby would continue on up to college,
                            when Mancenido realized that he wanted to build a career and a legacy out of it. <br><br>

                            "People would belittle my ideas sometimes, and even my parents would caution me every now
                            and then; but I know in my heart that I've got something to give. They may not understand it
                            now; but someday, when I'm already a full-fledged manufacturing engineer, they will,"
                            Mancenido said. <br><br>

                            The thought of contributing largely to society did not sink in until Mancenido himself saw
                            his work on national television. Congratulations were immediately in order for the humble
                            student from San Mateo, Rizal. Years of failures and self-conceptualizing have somehow bore
                            fruit, and this is just the beginning. The kid is only getting started. <br><br>

                            As he nears graduation, Mancenido looks back on his journey as a T.I.P.ian. It was the
                            institute's laboratories that inspired him to dream, and it's also how he envisions his
                            future workspace to be. <br><br>

                            Ariel Magat, program chair of T.I.P.'s electrical engineering department, lauded Mancenido's
                            4-in-1 rechargeable emergency kit, saying this multifunctional invention made from scraps
                            shows that "breakthroughs doesn't necessarily mean discovering new things, it may also be
                            about looking at improving those around us." <br><br>

                            "Mr. Marcenido's project would definitely open up other bright ideas from our students and
                            other young inventors out there. This would encourage them to explore integration of various
                            concepts and technology – things that are already on hand but just waiting to be tapped and
                            reproduced into innovative tools, gadgets, or equipment," he added. <br><br>
