          Dr. Teresita U. Quirino †: An Educator For Educators
        </h1>
        <div class="content-wrap">
          <img src="../assets/news/newsteresita2.jpg" alt="teresita" />
          <p>
            A wife to her first love. A mother to her four children. A friend to
            colleagues the world over. A mentor and teacher to employees and
            students alike. A stalwart of the Philippine educational scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Teresita “Tesy” U. Quirino was all of the above and many more.
            But undeniably, what strongly accompanied her name and her story is
            being a school founder to one of the country’s premier technological
            institutions: the Technological Institute of the Philippines
            (T.I.P.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Quirino's love for learning cannot be denied as seen in her
            impressive educational résumé. At a young age, she managed to earn
            multiple graduate degrees from prestigious schools both locally and
            abroad. This, even after being married at the age of 17 to her first
            love, Engr. Demetrio A. Quirino, Jr.. In fact, as a testament to the
            value she placed on education, she even brought her children along
            with her to classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            With all the knowledge she gained, she willingly gave back. Like her
            husband, she was a classroom teacher for many years even before
            T.I.P., focusing on topics such as language, speech, and personality
            development while Engr. Quirino taught algebra, trigonometry,
            analytic geometry, and calculus. Despite this, however, the two
            always felt that they could do more for the Philippines in general,
            and for the Filipino youth in particular
          </p>
          <p>
            On February 6, 1962, the two established T.I.P. with what limited
            resources they had. Their goal was clear and purposeful: to bring
            within the reach of the masses the blessings of higher education.
            But she did not immediately take a school administrator role for
            T.I.P. Rather, Dr. Quirino opted to go back to the classroom as an
            educator. She was a high school and Spanish college teacher at Saint
            Rita College from 1962-1967, after which she taught Spanish at
            T.I.P. for two years. She also taught Educational Management at the
            University of Santo Tomas Graduate School from 1974 to 1975.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Quirino eventually went all-in at T.I.P. to helm the school
            alongside her husband. She did so as faculty and administrator for
            eight years, as President for 30 years, and as Chairman for 16
            years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her leadership style was very memorable to everyone she worked with.
            Decisive yet highly charismatic and empathetic, Dr. Quirino was
            known for running meetings as efficiently as possible so she could
            spend the remaining time to talk about life and further bond with
            her employees. This endeared her to the T.I.P. Community who viewed
            her more as a mentor than a boss.
          </p>
          <p>
            This kindheartedness was reflective of her belief that to teach is
            to touch lives forever; that education is empowering; and that
            education gives people the chance at a successful life. As such, Dr.
            Quirino made a point to grant scholarships to T.I.P.’s
            less-privileged-but-deserving students. This has always been one of
            her expressions of generosity, above and beyond the concept of the
            school already being for underprivileged Filipino youth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her generosity also extended far beyond T.I.P.’s students. She was
            an avid supporter of various causes close to her heart, including
            those involved in health and education. Dr. Quirino’s passion in her
            advocacies was as infectious as it was inspiring, that she was often
            approached by organizations as an ambassador and speaker.
          </p>
          <p>Such was Dr. Quirino’s ability to rally others.</p>
          <p>
            This served her well during her term as PACU President from
            2004-2006, during which several PACU milestones were accomplished.
            Under Dr. Quirino’s leadership, PACU also successfully contested
            unreasonable provisions of a draft Commission on Higher Education
            Memorandum Order that adversely affected the Nursing Education
            Program. She is also vividly remembered for rallying the member
            schools to voice out concerns to the Commission on Higher Education
            via a one-page ad in leading dailies that subsequently led to change
            that benefited PACU member schools. Moreover, PACU was able to
            successfully propose amendments to RA 7722 (CHED Law), gaining
            crucial legislator support for the resolution of wage and labor
            issues in favor of private schools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Quirino concurrently served as Chair of PACU’s umbrella
            organization, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational
            Associations (COCOPEA), from 2005 to 2006.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her dedication towards improving Philippine education saw her being
            hailed as one of the PACU Person of the Year awardees in 2017. To
            date, she is one of only 10 individuals to have been given this
            accolade since PACU’s inception in 1932.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a long career in education and educational administration, Dr.
            Quirino closed the chapter on her T.I.P. Chairmanship in the second
            semester of School Year 2019-2020 as she assumed her new title as
            Chairman Emeritus. She handed over the care of the school to her
            daughter, current T.I.P. Chairman and President Dr. Elizabeth
            Quirino-Lahoz, who is ably supported in the day-to-day operations by
            T.I.P. Board Member and Executive Vice President Angel C. Lahoz;
            T.I.P. Vice Chairman and Senior Vice President Angelo Q. Lahoz; and
            T.I.P. 's professional managers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Quirino had this to say as she ended her chairmanship in 2019:
          </p>
          <p>
            “As I close the door to my chairmanship, it is my hope that it will
            also open the doors of opportunity to all of you, my fellow workers
            in T.I.P., to move and bring T.I.P. to greater heights of
            development and academic excellence.”
          </p>
          <p>
            From its humble beginnings, T.I.P. now has campuses in Quezon City
            and Manila, each with state-of-the art laboratories and facilities.
            From an initial enrollment of 2,400, T.I.P. now molds 20,000
            students for the current semester across its two campuses. The
            school has received numerous programmatic accreditations, awards,
            and accomplishments from local and international agencies. It is
            also positioning itself to be a premier research institution through
            T.I.P. TechnoCoRe, the school’s thrust towards Technopreneurship and
            Collaborative Applied Research with stakeholders.
          </p>
          <p>
            All these successes are enjoyed by T.I.P. students. All these
            accolades came from a deep value for quality education championed by
            Dr. Quirino.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite these accomplishments, she never took credit for them nor
            took these for granted. Rather, she said, “The best things that I
            possess and earn in life are God's boundless blessings. These are
            graces not only for me but for my family, the school, and the
            community which we serve. We are God's steward for educating
            Filipino youth in the Philippines.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Truly, everyone who shall remember Ma’am Tesy shall think of her
            with much love, admiration, and respect.
