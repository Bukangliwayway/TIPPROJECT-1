            <h3>OUTCOMES-BASED EDUCATION (OBE)</h3>
            <p>
              The T.I.P. Implementation of outcomes-based education was driven
              by the following external entities: 1) Regulatory bodies such as
              the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), the Professional
              Regulation Commission (PRC), International Maritime Organization
              (IMO), among others, 2) Local and international accrediting
              bodies, specifically, the Philippine Association of Colleges and
              Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA), the Philippine
              Technological Council-Accreditation and Certification Board for
              Engineering and Technology - Engineering Accreditation Commission
              (PTC - ACBET - EAC), and ABET, Inc., 3) International certifying
              bodies, and 4) Feedback from other external constituents. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The institutional outcome statement was formulated based on the
              T.I.P. graduates attributes. Outcomes at the program level and
              course level were also formulated aligned with institutional
              outcomes.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The framework which T.I.P. adopted in its OBTL implementation
              revolves around three important elements: 1) Intended Learning
              Outcomes (ILOs), 2) Teaching and Learning Activities (TLAs) and 3)
              Assessment Tasks (ATs).<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              In support of T.I.P.’s outcomes-based education and as a strategy
              to promote academic excellence, T.I.P. has also embarked on a
              proactive plan to implement outcomes-based teaching and learning
              or OBTL in all its academic programs using the City University of
              Hong Kong OBTL model.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The OBE process is also supported by facilities, management
              processes and procedures resources and support structures
              sub-systems.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              The results of the assessment and evaluation are used as inputs in
              the continual improvement of the instructional process
              specifically on the constructive alignment of ILOs, TLAs, and
              ATs.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              It is expected that the implementation of OBTL as part of T.I.P.’s
              OBE would hasten the realization of T.I.P.’s mission "to transform
              students into graduates with full competence in their fields of
              study and who also possess Filipino values, industry-desired
              values, and global citizen values”.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is also guided by existing T.I.P. internal policies and
              initiatives: 1) The T.I.P. Vision, Mission, Core Values, and Core
              Competencies, 2) T.I.P. Quality Policy, and 3) Other T.I.P.
              initiatives that supported the OBE implementation such as a) the
              T.I.P. Faculty and Staff Development Program, and b) The T.I.P.
              Student Development Program.<br />
