          <p>
            Eight years ago, the Technological Institute of the Philippines
            (T.I.P.) published a book entitled Teacher Teacher as part of its
            50th anniversary celebration. The book gave honor and praise, not
            just to the teachers who had been with T.I.P. since the beginning,
            but also to all the teachers who are working hard to educate
            generations and generations of Filipinos, so they too, can have a
            better future.
          </p>
          <p>
            T.I.P. founders Engr. Demetrio A. Quirino and Dr. Teresita U.
            Quirino started out as teachers themselves before they acted on
            their vision of doing more for the Filipino youth by founding an
            engineering educational institution. Since 1962, T.I.P. has been
            transforming students into graduates with full competence in their
            fields of studies and who also possess Filipino values,
            industry-desired values, and global citizen values.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teachers are the most significant component of any educational
            institution’s success. The book Teacher Teacher is T.I.P.’s way of
            giving thanks and showing appreciation for its teachers’ tireless
            efforts to meet the vision of the T.I.P. founders: to make T.I.P.
            the leading professional technological institution in the
            Philippines and to produce graduates who contribute to the welfare
            of society.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the shift to the new normal, T.I.P. understands that it is not
            just students who are experiencing challenges but teachers as well.
            The re-release of the book Teacher Teacher hopes to bring more
            inspiration to educators to continue giving their best in educating
            their students so they too can also be the best version of
            themselves.
