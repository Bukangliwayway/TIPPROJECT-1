              <h1>History</h1>
              <p>
                On February 8, 1962, a group of educators headed by Engr.
                Demetrio A. Quirino Jr. established the Technological Institute
                of the Philippines.
              </p>
              <p>TIP laid down its objectives:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>to maintain a high standard of instruction;</li>
                <li>
                  to bring within the reach of the masses the blessings of
                  higher education; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  to cooperate with the government in the implementation of its
                  amelioration programs.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The school committed itself to educating and developing men and
                women who could turn the wheels of progress and industry.
                T.I.P.’s initial offering of courses included Chemical
                Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering,
                Mechanical Engineering, and Architecture. It also offered
                Industrial Education, Industrial Arts, Liberal Arts, High
                School, and various trade courses.
              </p>
              <img src="assets/About TIP/Students.jpg" width="300px" alt="students" />
              <p>
                T.I.P.’s first site was the Lorenzana Building in Quiapo,
                Manila. The school had an initial enrollment of 2,400 which
                steadily increased throughout the years, prompting the school to
                slowly but surely expand. In 1967, it set up its main site at G.
                Puyat Street, Quiapo, Manila.
              </p>
              <p>
                T.I.P. then directed itself towards specialization in the field
                of technology. In 1977, it offered a two-year associate course
                in Marine Engineering. Then in 1980, the Liberal Arts,
                Education, and High School programs were phased out to make way
                for the school’s new thrust.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1981, additional buildings were leased and the T.I.P. P.
                Casal, Quiapo location was opened to accommodate the growing
                student population which had reached over 23,000. T.I.P. Arlegui
                was opened three years later across P. Casal, both areas being
                collectively known as the T.I.P. Manila campus. Currently,
                T.I.P. Manila has four (4) main buildings across the combined
                2.3-hectares of the two sites.
              </p>
              <p>
                The founders opened T.I.P. Quezon City in 1983 along 20th Avenue
                of Cubao as their answer to the Philippine government’s call for
                dispersal to decongest the Manila University Belt. Through the
                years, the Quezon City campus acquired adjacent properties,
                including a frontage along Aurora Boulevard in the early 2000s.
                At present, T.I.P. Quezon City has ten (10) main buildings
                spread out in its 3.3-hectare site.
              </p>
              <p>
                T.I.P.’s institutional campaign for quality began in 1999. The
                school’s Quality Management System (QMS) was certified compliant
                with the international standard ISO 9001:1994 by Det Norska
                Veritas (DNV) during this year. The T.I.P. QMS has since then
                passed regular ISO recertification and surveillance audits.
              </p>
              <p>
                The turn of the millennium also saw T.I.P.’s campaign to
                externally validate the quality of its programs. From 2000 to
                the present, T.I.P. has been voluntarily applying its programs
                for local and international accreditations from respected
                organizations. These accreditations include ones from ABET, the
                US-based global gold standard in engineering and computing
                accreditation; the Seoul Accord, a multilateral agreement among
                agencies allowing professional mobility between the Philippines
                and the pact’s signatory countries; Philippine Association of
                Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA)
                under the umbrella of the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of
                the Philippines (FAAP); the Philippine Technological Council;
                and the Philippine Computer Society (PCS) Information and
                Computing Accreditation Board (PICAB).
              </p>
              <p>
                During this period, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED)
                also awarded 16 Centers of Excellence and Centers of Development
                to both T.I.P. campuses. Moreover, CHED also awarded Autonomous
                Status to both T.I.P. Quezon City and T.I.P. Manila in 2016 and
                again in 2019. Autonomous status is the highest honor CHED can
                bestow upon a higher education institution.
              </p>
              <p>
                In response to the nationwide K-12 basic and secondary education
                program implementation, T.I.P. applied for and was granted
                permit to offer a standalone Senior High School (SHS) program in
                2015. The strands offered by the T.I.P. SHS currently include
                Science, Technology, and Mathematics (STEM); Accountancy,
                Business, and Management (ABM); and Humanities and Social
                Sciences (HUMSS).
              </p>
              <p>
                On top of its campaign towards programmatic excellence on a
                national and international level, T.I.P. also embarked on a new
                direction. Called T.I.P. TechnoCoRe, this thrust was established
                in 2017 to institutionalize Technopreneurship and Collaborative
                Applied Research into its brand of education. T.I.P. TechnoCoRe
                involves instilling the core technopreneurship skills of (1)
                problem-opportunity formulation, (2) ideation, (3) validation,
                and (4) execution into T.I.P. students, faculty members,
                researchers, and other stakeholders. T.I.P. TechnoCoRe also
                involves the active establishment of collaborative applied
                research partnerships with government, industry, and other
                organizations.
              </p>
              <p>
                As its commitment to this thrust, T.I.P. in 2019 opened the
                T.I.P. TechnoCoRe building in its Quezon City campus. It is a
                seven-storey innovation hub housing T.I.P.’s state-of-the-art
                classrooms, seminar rooms, computer rooms, and engineering,
                computing, and fabrication laboratories.
              </p>
              <p>
                Coming from the heels of collaboration, 2019 also saw T.I.P.
                partnering with the Far Eastern University (FEU) to establish
                Edustria High School at the LIMA Technology Center in Lipa,
                Batangas. This joint venture educational offering aims to
                provide industry-relevant education through active partnerships
                with nearby local and multinational corporations that shall
                enable its students to achieve meaningful careers, economic
                upliftment, and life aspirations.
              </p>
              <p>
                2020 saw the world getting hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. To
                ensure education continuity and the community’s safety, T.I.P.
                exclusively implemented online and flexible learning for all
                T.I.P. students in the 1st Semester of SY 2020-2021. Within
                months from the start of the pandemic, the institution focused
                on reengineering its services, redesigning processes, and
                conducting countless training to adequately prepare the school
                for this new normal of teaching and learning. T.I.P. LEADS—which
                stands for Learning Experience Using Alternative-Design
                Systems—came to be. It is the collectivity of all these efforts
                especially towards online student-centric initiatives. T.I.P.
                LEADS is the school’s innovative way of making the remote
                learning experience better for T.I.P.ians, wherever they may be.
              </p>
              <p>
                At present, despite the pandemic, the Technological Institute of
                the Philippines remains firmly committed to the preservation of
                global excellence, leadership in engineering and technological
                education in the Philippines, and continuous improvement for its
                students, alumni, and employees alike.

              A fusion of technology and traditional education. The willingness to evolve in the face of new challenges, while maintaining the same passion and steadfastness that build an institution. An institution that imbues its students with Filipino values, industry and global citizen values. An institution that transforms students into graduates who will contribute to the general welfare of society.

              The new T.I.P. logo is dominated by lines and symmetry, both important elements in engineering. Behind every great structure is the right mix of lines placed in symmetry.

              The proportion between the gray lower block and the white upper block is 60:40 to subliminally reinforce the idea of stability. The base, which is colored black, represents a firm and strong foundation. The white dots in our new T.I.P. acronym is our non-verbal way, in visual graphic form, to suggest to the reader to read TIP as T.I.P. and not as “tip”.

              in clean surroundings as the only way for real learning and
              working to take place.

              where work is towards helping others with little regard for
              self-interest. Teachers impart knowledge and give of themselves
              unselfishly. Employees and administrators serve with the knowledge
              that service to others is their reason for being, and the school,
              as a community, gives back to society.
            </p>
            <h3>Commitment to Extend Scholarship Grants</h3>
            <p>
              The allocation of the resources of the school to allow poor but
              deserving students access to quality education through
              scholarships and grants. This is a commitment of the school's
              founder to the Filipino youth, a commitment that will always be
              supported by T.I.P.

            <h1>T.I.P. Outcomes-Based Education</h1>
            <img src="assets/About TIP/obe.jpg" alt="obe" />
            <p>
              The T.I.P. Implementation of outcomes-based education was driven by the following external entities: 1) Regulatory bodies such as the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC), International Maritime Organization (IMO), among others, 2) Local and international accrediting bodies, specifically, the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA), the Philippine Technological Council-Accreditation and Certification Board for Engineering and Technology - Engineering Accreditation Commission (PTC - ACBET - EAC), and ABET, Inc., 3) International certifying bodies, and 4) Feedback from other external constituents.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is also guided by existing T.I.P. internal policies and initiatives: 1) The T.I.P. Vision, Mission, Core Values, and Core Competencies, 2) T.I.P. Quality Policy, and 3) Other T.I.P. initiatives that supported the OBE implementation such as a) the T.I.P. Faculty and Staff Development Program, and b) The T.I.P. Student Development Program.
            </p>
            <p>
              The institutional outcome statement was formulated based on the T.I.P. graduates attributes. Outcomes at the program level and course level were also formulated aligned with institutional outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The framework which T.I.P. adopted in its OBTL implementation revolves around three important elements: 1) Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs), 2) Teaching and Learning Activities (TLAs) and 3) Assessment Tasks (ATs).
            </p>
            <img src="assets/About TIP/quote.png" alt="quote" />
            <p>
              In support of T.I.P.’s outcomes-based education and as a strategy to promote academic excellence, T.I.P. has also embarked on a proactive plan to implement outcomes-based teaching and learning or OBTL in all its academic programs using the City University of Hong Kong OBTL model.
            </p>
            <p>
              The OBE process is also supported by facilities, management processes and procedures resources and support structures sub-systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              The results of the assessment and evaluation are used as inputs in the continual improvement of the instructional process specifically on the constructive alignment of ILOs, TLAs, and ATs.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is expected that the implementation of OBTL as part of T.I.P.’s OBE would hasten the realization of T.I.P.’s mission "to transform students into graduates with full competence in their fields of study and who also possess Filipino values, industry-desired values, and global citizen values”.
